# ThemeDeploy
Install WP theme ZIP file from any URL or plugin dir

## Use case
Your custom theme is in github and constantly updating so you dont want to download a fresh copy every time you setup a new site.
- Just install this plugin and use WP's Plugin Editor `wp-admin/plugin-editor.php` to enter the master ZIP URL
- Or fork and modify the plugin to hard-code your url
